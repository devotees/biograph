# Picography

Inspired by [Rand McNally's histomap](www.slate.com/features/2013/08/histomapwider.jpg), picography allows you to visualise and share a personal history.

What it does:
* Helps you craft narrative and meaning out of your past.
* Encourages you to recount people, places and events that you have unfortunately forgotten.
* Leads to questions like: Does the length of time you spent engaging with someone accurately reflect the impact they have had on your life? Is the value of a life proportional to how much of its time is filled with boxes?
* Can be shared with a friend and create a mutual state of vulnerability. Yum.
* Makes apparent just how much of your life has been empty space.
* Reveals to you how small a blip you and a lover are in each others' lives.

# Picography

Inspired by [Rand McNally's histomap](http://www.slate.com/features/2013/08/histomapwider.jpg), picography allows you to visualise and share a personal history.

Picographs are maps. Like other maps, they do not caputre the full depth and story of the terrain. They are instead guides for a journey and an exercise in considering and documenting the most meaningful parts of that slice of the universe.

What it does:
* Helps you craft narrative and meaning out of your past.
* Encourages you to recount people, places and events that you have unfortunately forgotten.
* Can be shared with a friend and create a mutual state of vulnerability. Yum.
* Makes apparent just how much of your life has been empty space.
* Reveals to you how small a blip you are in each others' lives.
